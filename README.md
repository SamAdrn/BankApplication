# BankApplication
## Organize every inch of detail of your banks, from various branches to individual customer accounts.
This application offer services to Banking Managers for organizing their data. First, create any number of banks you'd like, and each of them will be initialized with a Bank ID. Within a bank, will be a number of branches under the bank's operation. Each branch can have customers registered to the branch, and each customer can have up to 5 bank accounts.

Every action you take will all be saved to a SER file, so don't worry about losing your data. Launching the program the first time will give you some testing data to try out the program as you like. Once you're done exploring and decide you want manage a bank of your own, feel free to remove the existing bank from the database.

Note that this application was made by a beginner programmer, so it may not seem much. Right now, a working console UI and a GUI is provided to users. 
- To use the console UI, run the `main()` method in the `DriverApp` class located in the `ui.console` package.
- To use the GUI, run the `main()` method in the `GuiMain` class located in the `ui.gui` package.

Thanks a lot for coming here! Feel free to leave any feedback.
