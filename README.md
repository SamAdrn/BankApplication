# BankApplication
<b>Organize every inch of detail of your banks, from various branches to individual customer accounts.</b>
<br><br>
This application offer services to Banking Managers for organizing their data. First, create any number of banks you'd like, and each of them will be initialized with a Bank ID. To access the bank, enter its ID. Here, open up branches, add new customers, and take control of their individual accounts. Every action you take will all be saved to a SER file, so don't worry about losing your data. Launching the program the first time will give you some testing data to try out the program as you like. Once you're done exploring and decide you want manage a bank of your own, feel free to remove the existing bank from the database.
<br><br>
Note that this application was made by a beginner programmer, so it may not seem much. Right now, it only provides a console UI for you to use the application. I am planning to create a GUI out of JavaFX at some point, but I'll have to get myself familiarized with it first. Please leave some feedback, I would really appreciate those who consider making this little side project better. Thanks a lot for coming here!
